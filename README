img : Minimalistic screenshot uploader for Linux

img is a minimalistic bash script that uploads a screen selection to imgur.
On success, it copies the image link to the clipboard and sounds a bell.
On failure, it writes the curl output to /tmp/, where the image is also stored.
No output is produced.

img depends on scrot, curl and xclip.
You can use the following command to check dependencies:
    for p in scrot curl xclip; do test $(command -v $p) && echo "Ok $p" || echo "No $p"; done

Recommended usage: Bind a key (such as PrtSc) to execute the script easily.
Note: If you are using dwm, you will need to use the following patch for
screen selections: http://dwm.suckless.org/patches/keypressrelease.
