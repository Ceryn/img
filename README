img : Minimalistic screenshot uploader for Linux

img is a minimalistic bash script that uploads a screen selection to imgur.
On success, it copies the image link to the clipboard and sounds a bell.
On failure, it writes the curl output to /tmp/, where the image is also stored.
No output is produced.

img depends on scrot, curl and xclip.
